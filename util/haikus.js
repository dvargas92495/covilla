There once was a boy from Dubai 
Who smoke, and he drank, and got high
He lost bad in pong
So we all saw his dong
And that look made a few people cry

Ok that was good.
What else can we do today.
Maybe a sonnet?


What say thee of a kid who loves tub time
To run a shop alone without a shirt
He zooms he types and tries to stop the crime
Watch out, stay close, and try not to get hurt

One asks why pick that San Diego State
Why not support your friend: eleven seed
Thou bracket sir is getting kind of late
Now “Syracuse” is something of a creed.

Besiege his playing of the game of bridge
Poker, not now. No Avalon today.
He ventures off to see what’s in the fridge 
Pizza, he sighs. Stomach room must give way.

Just wait around and see that classic grin
To find the ball of energy within.

A quick interpretive dance

If you crash your struggling car
You can’t marry grace

Which is now the trend
You’ve set from meeting her fam
Y’all are moving fast`

Taste in cars? Not too shabby.
Music taste? Perfect.
